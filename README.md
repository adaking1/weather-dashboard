## Description

This website was created to give the current weather and the 5-day forecast of a specific city when that city is entered in the search bar. This project showcases the use of server-side API calls, as well as Google Fonts, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 


## Usage

Enter the name of a city into the search bar. When the search button is clicked, or enter is pressed, the current weather of that city will be displayed on the screen as well as its forecast for the next five days. The specific information provided for the current weather and 5-day forecast is the temperature, wind speed, and humidity percentage, as well as an icon representing the weather conditions.
